You’re always going to be learning new things.  It might be because you’re in college and taking classes that require you to learn and master certain knowledge and skills, or it might be because you have a hobby for which you’re exploring new ways of engaging.  And after college, you’ll be in a constant state of learning in whatever role you enter.  (If you think learning ends after college graduation, think again…).  Many people incorporate all of the notes they take and research content they gather into a **Personal Knowledge Management** (PKM) tool.  Some examples of PKM tools you may already know are [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/), and [OneNote](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app). Take a moment to research these tools to ensure you understand the general concept.

One common aspect of learning something is taking notes.  You’ve probably already started taking notes in CS3500, and you likely have lots of notes from classes you’ve taken in the past.  As we all know, there are countless strategies that one can employ in note-taking.  There’s the Cornell Method, the Visual Notes method, among others.  A somewhat modern note taking strategy encourages the learner to use Markdown to organize text files of content.  Markdown has the benefits of being simple to understand for both humans and computers, based in plain text files (as opposed to locked away in some proprietary file format or even more hidden somewhere in the cloud) and supports quick annotations as you type.
